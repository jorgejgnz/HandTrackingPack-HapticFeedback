# Hand Tracking Pack (Oculus Quest)
Unity project with some things I've been working on:

* Matching technique for getting 2D haptic feedback (virtual-real table)
* Turn your table into a whiteboard (fingers to paint, fist to erase)
* Fast hand gesture recognition
* Optimized 3D scanned room
* Virtual touchscreen
* Virtual piano
* VR shopping (POC)
